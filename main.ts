// 24.	More Conditional Tests: You don’t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. 
// If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests. 
// Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:
// • Tests for equality and inequality with strings
// • Tests using the lower case function
// • Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, 
//   greater than and less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to
// • Tests using "and" and "or" operators
// • Test whether an item is in a array
// • Test whether an item is not in a array
